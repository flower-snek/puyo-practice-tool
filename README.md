Puyo graphics (puyo0-3.png) from Puyo Puyo Tsu, ripped from Spriter's Resource here: https://www.spriters-resource.com/genesis_32x_scd/puyopuyo/sheet/96326/

Title screen uses the chalkboard puyos from Puyo Puyo Tetris 2, again ripped from Spriter's Resource here: https://www.spriters-resource.com/nintendo_switch/puyopuyotetris2/sheet/148653/

Colorblind friendly colors for the puyos started out from Paul Tol's color scheme, found at https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind; Paul Tol's site is here https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ (I would link the color scheme directly but I can't find it on this site). The colors I settled on in the end are not the same as those in the color scheme, but I figured I'd give them a shoutout anyways.

Patterns are compiled from the Puyo Puyo wiki, here's a few links: https://puyonexus.com/wiki/Tailing https://puyonexus.com/wiki/List_of_Chaining_Forms
