## puyo practice tool

This was my final project for my CMSC437 Graphical User Interfaces course at UMBC. To run it, you have to run `python3 main.py`. I didn't compile it or anything. I know it's inconvenient. You also probably need some packages but I don't remember what they would be since I'm writing this several months after graduating. I'm sure python will tell you.

Colorblind friendly colors for the puyos started out from Paul Tol's color scheme, found at https://davidmathlogic.com/colorblind; Paul Tol's site is here https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/ (I would link the color scheme directly but I can't find it on this site). The colors I settled on in the end are not the same as those in the color scheme, but I figured I'd give them a shoutout anyways.
